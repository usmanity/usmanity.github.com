  I started here working on the front-end redesign and to bring some new
  features into the UI. I've likened my work as user experience designer
  because all of it is ultimately seen by users. I code here using SCSS
  and javascript.  Although I'm primarily front-end, I've written backend
  code along with tests using ruby, ruby on rails, and rSpec.
