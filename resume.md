<p>
  I worked on the front-end redesign of the whole site.
  I've likened my work as user experience designer
  because all of it is ultimately seen by users. I code here using SCSS
  and javascript.  Although I'm primarily front-end, I've written backend
  code along with tests using ruby, ruby on rails, and rSpec.
</p>
<p>
Some of the front-end related work I've done here includes:
<ul>
  <li>Worked on in-store mobile product, BillFloat being a platform for retails to sell.</li>
  <li>Redesigned every page on the site with new design.</li>
  <li>Introduced SASS which allowed for quicker styling changes.</li>
  <li>Designed and built mobile webapp.</li>
  <li>Introduced Bootstrap, latest jQuery, and good CSS structure.</li>
</ul>

    At DoctorBase I worked as a designer and I wrote CSS and javascript
