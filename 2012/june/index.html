<h1>The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack</h1>
<h2>by Liars</h2>

I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far

I can always be found
I can always be found

If you need me
If you need me
If you need me

I can always be found
I can always be found

If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay

I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side

I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far

I can always be found
I will stay by your side
And I want you to find me
So, I'll stay by your side

If you need me
If you need me
If you need me

I can always be found
I can always be found
I can always be found

I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far

I can always be found
I can always be found
I can always be found
