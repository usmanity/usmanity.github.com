<h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
    I'm a web developer with a love for user experience. I live in San
    Francisco and I like photography. When I'm not coding, I like to eat
    good pizza, go try to discover something new in San Francisco, read
    about space. I also love NASA.

  Front-end Developer

  <span class='time_there'>
    (August 2011 - <em>Present</em>)
  </span>
</div>
<p>
  I started here working on the front-end redesign and bring some new
  features into the UI. I write code everyday but I like to treat my work
  as user experience designer because all of it is ultimately seen by
  users. I code here using SCSS and javascript.
  Although I'm primarily front-end, I've written backend code along with
  tests using ruby, ruby on rails, and rSpec.
</p>
<p>
Some of the front-end related work I've done here includes:
<ul>
  <li>Redesigned every page on the site with new design.</li>
  <li>Introduced SASS and moved code into scss from SCSS.</li>
  <li>Maintained support on Internet Explorer 7.</li>
  <li>Introduced Bootstrap, latest jQuery, and good CSS structure.</li>
</ul>

    At DoctorBase I worked as a designer and I wrote CSS and javascript
code. I implemented doctor profile pages, maintained homepage styling,
and did regular updates to the front-end. I also got my first exposure
to perl and template toolkit.
