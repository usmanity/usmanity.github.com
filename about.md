# About me

I'm a web developer with a background in front-end technologies like css, 
javascript, and photoshop. I work at
[BillFloat](http://BillFloat.com) on the front-end team. I love
music, typography, UX, and photography. You can see things I've done on
[github](http://git.io/usmanity). I worked on the redesign at BillFloat.
You can look around and get in touch with me.
