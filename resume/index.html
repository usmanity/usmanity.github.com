  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I'm a front-end focused web developer. As a hobby photographer I like to shoot while traveling, shoot the night sky, and shoot underwater. I like to ride bikes (both with and without motors). Some of my interests in web development are typography, continuous integration, client-side logic handling, and taking advantages of ripple effects in styling.</p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
    <h3 class="subheader">CSS & HTML</h3>
      <p>
        I've used CSS & HTML together for about four years now. Early on, I worked on static sites and once I got familiar with grids, forms, and styling all sorts of HTML elements, I started using SCSS. Along with SCSS, I've experimented with LESS and Stylus. I'm a object oriented CSS user, which entails taking a programmatic approach to writing CSS. I contribute code to <a href="https://github.com/relearn/simplux">simplux</a>.
      </p>
    <h3 class="subheader">Javascript</h3>
      <p>
        A big thanks goes to jQuery for showing me what's possible with javascript while I also made a ton of mistakes early on with javascript due to not understanding this powerful language. I've been writing production code in javascript for about one year. I also try my hand at writing smaller apps with node.js. Libraries I have used which are writing in javascript include backbone.js and jQuery. Recently I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/usmanity/orca">orca</a>.
      </p>
    <h3 class="subheader">Ruby</h3>
      <p>
        Ruby is my current favorite scripting language for quick tools. I've written Ruby on Rails, but I am not as proficient as I'd like to be in this area. My most recent ruby project is a <a href="https://github.com/usmanity/cycling">cycling page scraper</a>. 
      </p>
    <h3 class="subheader">Unix Tools</h3>
      <p>
        My favorite unix tool that I use daily is git, it has saved me tons of time and I love learning more about it. I have about 3 years of experience using git. I also writing quick shell scripts in almost all my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/usmanity">github</a>.
