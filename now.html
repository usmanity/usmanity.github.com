        Personal: I've been reading a lot more recently. It helps me de-stress but also I'm learning new things by
        reading about different topics. A recent favorite has been <oblique>Maus</oblique> by Art Speigelman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning: Apart from reading about non-technical things, I've been trying to learn more ruby-centric things.
        Haven't moved onto Rails proper yet but I think I will take my sweet time getting there ü§£.

        Travel: In October, I'm going to Yosemite and Southern California.
