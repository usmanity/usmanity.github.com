            Work: in June, Weebly became part of Square so now I'm a Square employee. I'm still working on
            Weebly projects and staying with the team.

            Travel: I just got back from a week long trip. We (Kristen &amp; I) went to southern California
            and Arizona to visit her family. It is extremely hot down there, hottest temperature I've ever
            been in, at 117ÂºF!

            Personal: I'm focusing more on eliminating distractions or wasteful things in my everyday life.
            I started riding my bike back in May and have continued to ride it pretty steadily. I'm feeling
            better about each ride as I'm getting stronger.

            Learning: my focus has been to study &amp; build node.js apps recently, I'm still not very good
            at it but I'm hoping to continue learning more, it's mostly about being disciplined now.
