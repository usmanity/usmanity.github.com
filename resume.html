          I work on the Growth team to help increase conversions and make our users
          happy. Projects I've worked on include first-time user onboarding
          from conversion on landing pages, signup behavior,
          and creating the user's first site. Other projects include a guide
          system that helps users learn the essentials about creating a site
          and then getting to publishing those sites. Technologies used here include
          JavaScript/ES6 (with Backbone and Vue.js), PHP (including Laravel), SCSS,
          webpack, and MySQL.

          I laid the foundational work for the front end app using Angular.js.
          As part of a team of four people, I worked on designing, prototyping, and
          iterating on new product features. I worked on adding a dashboard for
          customers to interact with and rely on for realtime updates.
          Technologies used: Javascript (angular.js), grunt, SCSS, and HTML.

          I introduced quicker development cycles by narrowing down moving parts
          in the deploy process including introducing Javascript and CSS preprocessing.
          Added new UI flows within a quarter of the time after introducing
          better development practices.
